Sure! This part of the code is checking the memoization array to see if the solution to the current subproblem has been calculated before. Here's what it's doing in simpler words:

Check if the solution is already calculated (memo[idx][0] != -1):

If memo[idx][0] is not equal to -1, it means that the algorithm has already calculated and stored the solution for this specific subproblem where the presentation at index idx is excluded.
Check if the presentation was selected (memo[idx][1] == 1):

If memo[idx][1] is equal to 1, it means that when the presentation at index idx was included (selected) in the optimal solution, the algorithm had marked it as selected.
Setting the selected_indices array:

Based on the information in the memo array, the code decides whether to mark the presentation at index idx as selected (1) or not selected (-1) in the selected_indices array.
Return the stored solution (memo[idx][0]):

Finally, the code returns the stored solution for the subproblem, which is the maximum popularity score when the presentation at index idx is excluded.
In essence, this part of the code is checking if the solution for the current subproblem has been computed before and stored in the memoization array. If it has, the code uses that stored solution and information about whether the presentation was selected or not to avoid recalculating and to fill the selected_indices array accordingly.


.........................

This part of the code is updating the memoization array with the result of the current subproblem and deciding whether to mark the presentation at index idx as selected or not selected. Let's break it down step by step:

Comparing include and exclude:

The code is comparing the popularity score when the presentation at index idx is included (include) and when it's excluded (exclude).
Deciding whether to include or exclude:

If the popularity score from including the presentation is greater than or equal to the popularity score from excluding it (include >= exclude), it means that including the presentation in the solution would give a better result.
Updating selected_indices and memoization array:

If including the presentation is better, then:
The code sets selected_indices[idx] to 1, indicating that the presentation at index idx is selected in the optimal solution.
It updates memo[idx][1] with the calculated popularity score (include).
If excluding the presentation is better, then:
The code sets selected_indices[idx] to -1, indicating that the presentation at index idx is not selected in the optimal solution.
It updates memo[idx][-1] (which is equivalent to memo[idx][0]) with the calculated popularity score (exclude).
Returning the result:

Finally, the code returns the calculated popularity score for the current subproblem, which has been stored in the memoization array. This result will be used by higher-level subproblems or the main problem to build the overall solution.
In essence, this part of the code is responsible for making a decision on whether to include or exclude the presentation at index idx based on which choice leads to a better popularity score. It updates the memoization array with the result and selected status for this subproblem.
