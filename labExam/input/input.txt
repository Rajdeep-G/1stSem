The Indian economy is a complex and dynamic entity that has undergone significant transformations over the years. As one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, it plays a pivotal role in the global economic landscape. In recent decades, India has experienced remarkable economic growth and development, with various factors contributing to its evolving economic trajectory.
To understand the Indian economy, it is essential to consider its historical context. India's economic history is characterized by ancient trade routes, a rich agricultural tradition, and a colonial past. British colonial rule significantly impacted India's economy, leading to the exploitation of its resources and stagnation in economic growth. Independence in 1947 marked a turning point, and India embarked on a journey of economic self-sufficiency.
